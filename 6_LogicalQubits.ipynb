The current decoding circuit measures the first physical qubit as the logical qubit after the (placeholder) error correction. However, the repetition code typically infers the logical state from the majority vote of the physical qubits after error correction. The current decoding circuit also includes syndrome measurements which are not used for conditional corrections in the static circuit. Let's refine the decoding circuit to perform a majority vote measurement on the physical qubits and remove the unused syndrome measurements to simplify and focus on the final logical state determination.\n",

        "The tests are still failing even without noise, and the success rates are around 50%, which indicates the decoding measurement is not correctly reflecting the encoded logical state. The current decoding circuit measures the first physical qubit, which after encoding the |0> state with Hadamard and CNOTs (which creates a GHZ-like state |00...0> + |11...1>), will be in a superposition and measuring it will yield 0 or 1 with ~50% probability. Similarly for the |1> initial state. The repetition code protects the logical state by encoding it into the parity of the physical qubits. To decode, we need to measure the state of the logical qubit. In the repetition code context, the logical |0> state is encoded as |00...0> and logical |1> as |11...1>. After noisy evolution, the state will be a mixture. To determine the logical state, we need to measure the physical qubits and infer the logical state. A common way to decode the repetition code is by measuring all physical qubits and taking a majority vote. However, the current test setup expects a single 'decoded_logical_qubit' measurement key.\n",

        "Let's modify the encoding circuit so that the initial logical state is directly encoded into the |00...0> or |11...1> state, rather than using a Hadamard on the first qubit. This aligns better with the standard repetition code where |0>_L = |00...0> and |1>_L = |11...1>. Then, the decoding circuit should measure all physical qubits, and the test function should perform the majority vote classically on these outcomes to determine the decoded logical state. We will still measure the first physical qubit as 'decoded_logical_qubit' for compatibility with the test function structure, but the analysis in the test function should ideally use the majority vote from 'physical_qubit_outcomes'. Let's update the test function to perform the majority vote analysis.\n",

        "*   Decoding the repetition code against bit-flip errors is typically done by measuring each physical qubit and applying a classical majority vote to determine the most likely logical state.\n",
        "*   Increasing the number of physical qubits (code distance) generally improves the success rate of correctly decoding the logical state in the presence of noise, especially at lower noise levels.\n",
        "*   Increasing the noise strength (probability of error per qubit) significantly reduces the success rate, as the majority vote decoder can be overwhelmed by multiple errors.\n",
        "*   Depolarizing noise (which includes bit-flip and phase-flip errors) tends to be slightly harder for the repetition code to correct compared to pure bit-flip noise at similar strengths, because the majority vote on Z-basis measurements primarily addresses bit-flip errors.\n",
